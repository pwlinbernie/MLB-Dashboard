# MLB Dashboard

This project is an MLB analytics dashboard built with Python.
It uses a SQLite database (`MLBDashboard.db`) and several CSV datasets
(`batter.csv`, `pitcher.csv`, `team.csv`) to analyze team and player performance.

## Project Structure

- `data/`  
  - `batter.csv` – batting stats by player  
  - `pitcher.csv` – pitching stats by player  
  - `team.csv` – team-level stats  

- `db/`  
  - `MLBDashboard.db` – SQLite database for the dashboard  

- `src/`  
  - (will contain Python scripts for the dashboard & database connection)
